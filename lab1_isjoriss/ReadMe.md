Iterative Merge Sort
----------


2.7.14

This lab implements iterative merge sort on an array given by the user (via the command line)

the sortPart function does not work properly. (It does not work after we increase the size of the slices)

Sample output:
BEFORE: 1 4 3 2 5 6 8 7
Size = 1 
1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 
1 4 2 3 0 0 0 0 
1 4 2 3 5 6 0 0 
1 4 2 3 5 6 7 8 
Size = 2
1 2 2 2 5 6 7 8 
1 2 2 2 5 6 7 8 
Size = 4
1 2 2 2 5 6 7 8 
AFTER:  1 2 2 2 5 6 7 8
