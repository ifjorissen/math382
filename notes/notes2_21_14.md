### Bad choice of Pivot?

min/max value makes the recurrence:

```

T(n) = n + T(n-1)
T(1) = 1

T(n) = n + T(n-1)
     = n + T(n-1) + T(n-2)
     = ...
     = /summation(from i to n) = n(n+1)/2 = theta(n^2)
     
_____________________________
     
 The following has the same recurrence as Merge Sort, theta(nlgn)
 T(n) = n + 2T(n/2)
 T(1) = 1     
     
```

### How to choose a pivot?

* median (not used in practice)
* randomized pivot
  * pick index {p...r} at random   
  * Select(n/1, A) --> randomized pivot, expected r.t of theta(n)
* deterministic median finder --> expected r.t of theta(n) as well
  * recursively find the median (of the median).  
* (in practice )median of three
  * `p, floor((p+r)/2) r,`
* (in practice) always choose right or left
  * in practice this is going to be terrible if the list is mostly or completely sorted.
  
### A Decent Pivot is Okay:
* Suppose Split is always 3:1
* Recursion tree
*  ```
                    n
                   / \
                  /   \
                 /     \
             3/4n       1/4n
             /\           /\
            /  \         /  \
       9/16n  3/16n   3/16n 1/16n
       ...
   ```   
     
 Left hand side is log[base4]n (has at most this many "levels")
 Right hand side if log[base4/3]n 
 so nlog <sub>4</sub> (n) <= T(n) <= nlog <sub>4/3</sub>(n)

### To resolve:
* Pivot
* Worst case r.t performance ---> O(n^2)
* "expected" r.t performance ---> theta(nlgn)
* average r.t performance ---> theta(nlgn)
* expected performance
  * expected number of comparisons made by randomized quicksort
    * dividing things into piles
    * at random something is "lit up" and we use this value as pivot
    * so when do two items get compared? (we compare against pivot)  At some point, the pivot is in the same pile as other elements, so they get compared.

#### Average number of comparisons
Let data values in A[1..n] be drawn from a1<a2<...<an  
Consider all permutations of <a1...an>  
Choose some permutation, *pi* is an element of Sn.
Let A[i] := a<sub>pi(i)</sub>.  
Let T(Api)= be number of comparisons made.

```
Avg(n) = (1/n!)/summation(for pi in Sn)[T(A(pi)]
Avg(n) = (1/n)/summation(from 1 to n-1)[Avg(i) + Avg(n-i)] + n
This is theta(nlgn)

Example a3 = 3,5,8
pi = <3,1,2> in S3
A = <8, 3, 5>
```
